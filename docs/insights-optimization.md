# Insights Pre-Computation Optimization

> **CCE Scheduler Service** — Pre-computed transition metrics for the Insights Service  
> **Status**: Implemented | **Target**: v1.1.0  
> **Last Updated**: 2026-05-22  
> **Deployment Model**: Fresh deployment (no existing data to migrate)

---

## 1. Problem Statement

The Scheduler Service drives time-based state transitions (`PENDING → DUE → OVERDUE → MISSED/SKIPPED`) for step instances. The Insights Service queries `step_instance` for state distribution, overdue trends, and missed-step analysis. These queries scan the full `step_instance` table on every dashboard load.

Currently, the Scheduler Service has **no persistent record** of transitions it has triggered — it publishes Kafka events and moves on. This means:

1. **The Insights Service cannot query transition history** — e.g., "how many steps transitioned to OVERDUE in the last 7 days?" requires scanning `step_instance.updated_at` and inferring state changes
2. **Step state distribution** requires `GROUP BY state` on the full `step_instance` table (potentially hundreds of thousands of rows)
3. **Trend analysis** (e.g., overdue rate over time) is impossible without a transition log

### 1.1 Design Constraint: No Core Table Denormalization

> **Customer directive:** Core operational tables must NOT be modified for insights purposes. Instead, all insights data is served from **separate pre-computed tables** that are updated incrementally in real-time by service code.
>
> These pre-computed tables are **temporary** — they will be replaced by a dedicated data pipeline in a future release. Both tables defined here (`transition_log`, `step_state_snapshot`) are self-contained and droppable without affecting core scheduler functionality.

## 2. Optimizations Owned by Scheduler Service

### 2.1 New Table: `transition_log`

**Problem:** The Insights Service cannot query "when did each step transition to its current state?" without scanning the full table and inferring from timestamps. Deviation trends by date require joining `deviation` with `step_instance` and grouping by `detected_at`.

**Solution:** The Scheduler Service persists a log entry for each state transition it triggers, creating a queryable audit trail. The `protocol_definition_id` is resolved at write time by JOINing `step_instance → protocol_instance`, avoiding the need to add it to `step_instance` directly.

**Schema:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE transition_log (
    id                   UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    step_instance_id     UUID NOT NULL,
    protocol_instance_id UUID NOT NULL,
    protocol_definition_id UUID,               -- resolved via step_instance → protocol_instance at write time
    action_id            VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
    from_state           VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,  -- PENDING, DUE, OVERDUE
    to_state             VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,   -- DUE, OVERDUE, MISSED, SKIPPED
    transition_type      VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,   -- PENDING_TO_DUE, DUE_TO_OVERDUE, OVERDUE_TO_MISSED
    transitioned_at      TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    partition_index      INTEGER NOT NULL        -- scheduler partition that triggered this
);

CREATE INDEX idx_transition_log_step ON transition_log (step_instance_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_transition_log_time ON transition_log (transitioned_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_transition_log_type ON transition_log (transition_type);
CREATE INDEX idx_transition_log_protocol ON transition_log (protocol_instance_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_transition_log_protocol_def ON transition_log (protocol_definition_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_transition_log_partition ON transition_log (partition_index);
```

**Update trigger:** In `SchedulerLoop.executeCycle()`, after successfully publishing the Kafka trigger event for each step, also persist a `transition_log` entry in the same cycle. The `protocol_definition_id` is read from the associated `protocol_instance` (resolved via `step_instance.protocol_instance_id`).

**Insights Service query enablement:**

| New Capability | Query |
|----------------|-------|
| Transition trends over time | `SELECT DATE(transitioned_at), transition_type, COUNT(*) FROM transition_log GROUP BY 1, 2` |
| Steps transitioned to OVERDUE in date range | `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM transition_log WHERE transition_type = 'DUE_TO_OVERDUE' AND transitioned_at BETWEEN ? AND ?` |
| Avg time in DUE before OVERDUE | `SELECT AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (tl2.transitioned_at - tl1.transitioned_at))/86400) FROM transition_log tl1 JOIN transition_log tl2 ON tl1.step_instance_id = tl2.step_instance_id WHERE tl1.transition_type = 'PENDING_TO_DUE' AND tl2.transition_type = 'DUE_TO_OVERDUE'` |
| Missed step volume by action | `SELECT action_id, COUNT(*) FROM transition_log WHERE to_state = 'MISSED' GROUP BY action_id` |

---

### 2.2 New Table: `step_state_snapshot`

**Problem:** The Insights Service computes step state distribution (`PENDING`, `DUE`, `OVERDUE`, `MISSED`, `COMPLETED`, `SKIPPED` counts) by running `GROUP BY state` on the full `step_instance` table. At scale (100K+ steps), this is expensive and runs on every dashboard load.

**Solution:** The Scheduler Service maintains a periodic snapshot of state distribution, updated at the end of each scan cycle.

**Schema:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE step_state_snapshot (
    id                     UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    protocol_definition_id UUID,               -- NULL for global snapshot
    facility_id            VARCHAR(100),        -- NULL for global/protocol-level snapshot (future extension)
    pending_count          INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    due_count              INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    overdue_count          INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    missed_count           INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    completed_count        INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    skipped_count          INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    total_count            INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    snapshot_at            TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);

-- Functional unique index handles NULLs correctly for UPSERT
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_snapshot_protocol_facility
    ON step_state_snapshot (
        COALESCE(protocol_definition_id, '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000'::uuid),
        COALESCE(facility_id, '')
    );
```

**Update trigger:** At the end of each `SchedulerLoop.executeCycle()` (after all transitions for the current partition), recalculate the global state counts. The `protocol_definition_id` is resolved via `step_instance → protocol_instance` JOIN:

```sql
INSERT INTO step_state_snapshot (protocol_definition_id, facility_id, pending_count, due_count, overdue_count, missed_count, completed_count, skipped_count, total_count, snapshot_at)
SELECT
    NULL, NULL,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE si.state = 'PENDING'),
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE si.state = 'DUE'),
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE si.state = 'OVERDUE'),
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE si.state = 'MISSED'),
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE si.state = 'COMPLETED'),
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE si.state = 'SKIPPED'),
    COUNT(*),
    now()
FROM step_instance si
ON CONFLICT (COALESCE(protocol_definition_id, '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000'::uuid), COALESCE(facility_id, ''))
DO UPDATE SET
    pending_count = EXCLUDED.pending_count,
    due_count = EXCLUDED.due_count,
    overdue_count = EXCLUDED.overdue_count,
    missed_count = EXCLUDED.missed_count,
    completed_count = EXCLUDED.completed_count,
    skipped_count = EXCLUDED.skipped_count,
    total_count = EXCLUDED.total_count,
    snapshot_at = now();
```

> **Trade-off:** The snapshot is eventually consistent — it reflects state distribution as of the last scan cycle (default: every 5 seconds). For dashboard purposes, this is acceptable. The Insights Service can show `snapshot_at` to indicate data freshness.

**Insights Service query replacement:**

| Current Query | Replacement |
|---------------|-------------|
| Step state distribution (`GROUP BY state` on step_instance) | `SELECT * FROM step_state_snapshot WHERE protocol_definition_id IS NULL AND facility_id IS NULL` |
| State distribution per protocol | `SELECT * FROM step_state_snapshot WHERE protocol_definition_id = ? AND facility_id IS NULL` |

> **Note:** Per-protocol and per-facility snapshots are optional extensions. The initial implementation should focus on the global snapshot only, adding protocol/facility breakdowns if the Insights Service requires them.

---

## 3. Consistency Guarantees

- **`transition_log`** — Persisted in the same database transaction as the Kafka publish success check. If the Kafka publish fails, no log entry is created (the transition didn't happen).
- **`step_state_snapshot`** — Eventually consistent (refreshed every scan cycle). The `snapshot_at` timestamp indicates data freshness.

### 3.1 No Backfill Required

Since this is a fresh deployment with no existing data, all tables are created in the initial schema. `transition_log` populates organically as the scheduler triggers state transitions. `step_state_snapshot` is computed at the end of each scan cycle. No backfill migrations are needed.

## 4. Summary of Changes

| Change | Type | Table | Updated By | Trigger |
|--------|------|-------|-----------|---------|
| New `transition_log` table | Table | New | Scheduler | Each state transition |
| New `step_state_snapshot` table | Table | New | Scheduler | End of each scan cycle |

> **Note:** No columns are added to the `step_instance` table. The `step_instance` schema remains unchanged. The `protocol_definition_id` needed by `transition_log` and `step_state_snapshot` is resolved via JOIN at write time.

### 4.1 Flyway Migration Plan (Fresh Deployment)

All optimizations are included in the initial schema:

| Order | Migration | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| V1 | `V1__create_scheduler_lease.sql` | Scheduler core tables |
| V2 | `V2__create_transition_log.sql` | Transition log table with 5 indexes |
| V3 | `V3__create_step_state_snapshot.sql` | Step state snapshot table |
| V4 | `V4__fix_snapshot_unique_constraint.sql` | Replace UNIQUE constraint with COALESCE functional index |
| V5 | `V5__add_partition_index_idx.sql` | Add partition_index index on transition_log |

### 4.2 Configuration Additions

| Property | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `cce.scheduler.transition-log.enabled` | `true` | Enable/disable transition logging |
| `cce.scheduler.snapshot.enabled` | `true` | Enable/disable state snapshot refresh |
| `cce.scheduler.snapshot.protocol-level` | `false` | Enable per-protocol breakdowns in snapshot |

## 5. Future: Data Pipeline Replacement

All pre-computed tables defined in this document are **temporary**. They will be replaced by a dedicated data pipeline in a future release. When the data pipeline is implemented:

1. Drop the pre-computed tables (`transition_log`, `step_state_snapshot`)
2. Remove the corresponding repository, entity, and service code
3. Core `step_instance` table remains completely unchanged — no rollback needed
4. The Insights Service switches from querying pre-computed tables to querying the data warehouse
